# Ideas for 'tinyren'

The primary motivation is obviously to implement the software renderer, which takes in some specifications of the scene and generates
an image file with the rendered scene.

Possible next steps:
- Render to some window in real-time
- Have the scene be animated (e.g. rotating around Z axis)
- Allow camera control
- Do rendering on GPU with CUDA/OpenCL
